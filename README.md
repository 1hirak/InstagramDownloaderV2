## About
Originally I wrote this project several months back and it was very poorly written. 
It used Regex to parse data from HTML, WebClient for requests, wasn't multi-threaded and overall it was a mess. 
I've been reading more about programming lately and decided to re-do this project from scratch to see how far I've come and also improve the scalability of the project.
